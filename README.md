## ⚠️ Warning

## ➕ More information
- JoyCode Studios can get busy at times and PilotAI will not be updated quite frequently.
- The PilotAI website code is not located in this repository, and is currently not open-source, we are working to make this open-source, but this can take time.
- The PilotAI desktop and mobile apps are not yet available, but we are working to make those apps available.
- The PilotAI **macOS/iOS** apps will take longer to produce as JoyCode Studios currently doesn't have access to the resources needed to produce the **macOS/iOS** apps, we are working to change this


---


## Roadmap
- Make desktop and mobile apps
- Make PilotAI web open-source
- Get access to resources needed to make **macOS/iOS**
- Make **macOS/iOS** applications
